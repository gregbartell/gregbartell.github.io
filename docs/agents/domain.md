# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when
exploring the codebase.

## Layout

This is a single-context repo:

- Read `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root for domain language.
- Read relevant ADRs under `docs/adr/` before changing behavior or
  architecture.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md`
- Relevant files in `docs/adr/`

If any of these files do not exist, proceed silently. The domain-modeling flow
creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do
not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept is missing from the glossary, note it as a possible
domain-modeling follow-up.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than
silently overriding it.
